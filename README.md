## Installation

Location of the WebStorm folder is depending on OS and WebStorm version. See section [Project and IDE settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/project-and-ide-settings.html) for more information about the configuration directory structure.

Linux users can use the [installer](https://github.com/mauchede/webstorm-config/blob/master/bin/installer):

```sh
# Use local installation

bin/installer install

# Use remote installation

curl --location "https://github.com/mauchede/webstorm-config/raw/master/bin/installer" | sh -s -- install
